    "# Introduction to Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to your first Jupyter notebook! We will be using notebooks like these throughout the course to teach you concepts in data science and machine learning. Jupyter notebooks are like interactive coding worksheets; you can create __text blocks__ (like this one) and __code blocks__ (like the one below). Text blocks use [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), a simple language for creating rich text, which also supports inline HTML. Code blocks contain code which can be run, and the output of a code block is saved even after you close the notebook. The programming language used in the code block depends on the __kernel__ that you select; for this course you should always use the custom Python kernel that you created from your Anaconda environment.\n",
